# code-examples
some snippets of code I have worked on.

I have posted a collection of code by different languages here. The C++ folder contains application assignments code from SMU.
The C# folder has class files from my Godot game which is current private. And the GML file contains an example of a network
system aswell as an observer system I was working on in Gamemaker Studio 2.
